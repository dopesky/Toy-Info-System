# Toy Info System
Implementation of Java Sockets to show RPC communication between a server and 
clients.

## Requirements

- Java JDK >= 10.x [Installation Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A)

## Running the Project
In the root folder there is a `run.vbs` file which you can open to start the project. You can also open the `run.bat` file if the `run.vbs` does not run as expected. If the 2 files are erroneous, there exists an
executable JAR file in the `target` folder which you can execute by clicking or running `javaw -jar target/projectds-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` from the root directory. 

## Running through the Intelliji IDE
In your IDE, just open the `App.java` file and run it. This file can be found in the `com.strathmore.projectds.gui` package.
